# safejoin 0.2.0

`safejoin` is now deprecated. As of version [`1.1.1`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/news/index.html#dplyr-111) dplyr has a `relationship` argument that provides the same functionality that `safejoin` was created for. See the dplyr docs [https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html) for complete details.

# safejoin 0.1.0
