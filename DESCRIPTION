Package: safejoin
Title: Perform "Safe" Table Joins
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Sam",
           family = "Edwardes",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "edwardes.s@gmail.com")
Description: The goal of 'safejoin' is to guarantee that when performing joins extra rows are not added to your data. 'safejoin' provides a wrapper around 'dplyr::left_join' that will raise an error when extra rows are unexpectedly added to your data. This can be useful when working with data where you expect there to be a many to one relationship but you are not certain the relationship holds.
